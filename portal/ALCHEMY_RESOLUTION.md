# Alchemy Issue Resolution Summary

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Block Range Limit Error

### The Problem
Alchemy API returned this error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "error":{
    "code":-32600,
    "message":"You can make eth_getLogs requests with up to a 500 block range. Based on your parameters, this block range should work: [0x2710, 0x2903]"
  }
}
```

### Root Cause Discovery
- ‚úÖ **API Key was valid** - The connection worked fine
- ‚ùå **Block range too large** - We requested 10,000 blocks, Alchemy limits to 500
- ‚ùå **No request chunking** - Single large requests exceeded provider limits

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Updated Block Range Configuration
```bash
# Before
NEXT_PUBLIC_HISTORICAL_BLOCKS=10000

# After  
NEXT_PUBLIC_HISTORICAL_BLOCKS=500      # Total blocks to fetch
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKS_PER_REQUEST=200     # Blocks per individual request
```

#### 2. Added Automatic Request Chunking
- Requests > 200 blocks are automatically split into chunks
- 100ms delay between chunks to respect rate limits
- Comprehensive logging for each chunk operation

#### 3. Enhanced Event Filtering
- Filter by contract address AND known event signatures
- Skip unknown events gracefully without breaking decode process
- Added event signature extraction from contract ABI

#### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better logging shows exactly which API calls fail and why  
- Detailed chunk progress tracking
- Graceful fallback to other providers if needed

### How It Works Now

```typescript
// Example: Fetching 500 blocks gets split into:
// Chunk 1: blocks 1000-1199 (200 blocks)
// Chunk 2: blocks 1200-1399 (200 blocks) 
// Chunk 3: blocks 1400-1499 (100 blocks)
```

### Testing Tools Added

1. **Alchemy Debug Panel** (`/activity` page)
   - Test API connection
   - Verify chain ID (should be Sepolia: 11155111)
   - Check event signature extraction

2. **Enhanced Console Logging**
   - Track chunk progress: `üì¶ Fetching chunk: blocks X - Y`
   - API call details: `üîç Calling Alchemy API`  
   - Success confirmation: `‚úÖ Chunk completed: N logs`

3. **Runtime Configuration**
   - Switch providers on the fly: `window.web3kit.eventControls`
   - Test different strategies without restarts

### Performance Impact
- **Before**: 1 request √ó 10,000 blocks = ‚ùå API Error
- **After**: ~3 requests √ó 200 blocks each = ‚úÖ ~1-2 second total time

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated system on `/activity` page
2. Remove debug panel once confirmed working  
3. Monitor real usage for any remaining edge cases

**Status**: üéâ Ready for testing - the chunking system should resolve the Alchemy 400 error!
